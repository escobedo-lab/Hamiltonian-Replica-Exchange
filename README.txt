The following files are provided:

(1) Sample input LAMMPS data files for different photoacid generator (PAG) chemistries 
	in poly(4-hydroxy styrene) and poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) homopolymers and alternating copolymers.

(2) Modified LAMMPS source scripts are provided to carry out Hamiltonian Replica Exchange.
	Please check the comments to see where the original scripts are edited.

(3) LAMMPS scripts to run high PAG concentration simulations. 
	Sequence for running the LAMMPS scripts for high PAG simulations:in.adapt->in.startljcoul->in.final

More details on the Metropolis acceptance, OPLS-AA forcefield parameters, and simulation protocols can be
found in the manuscript titled: Atomistic modeling approach for predicting association of photoacid 
generators in extreme unltraviolet polymeric photoresists
